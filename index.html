				<p>
					The tool will allow you to create simple decorative blocks, without any programming,
					which you can then add to Minetest as a mod.
				</p>
				<p>
					Modding in Minetest is easy. If you are going to create anything more complicated
					than a static block, then you need to learn how to program in Lua.
					Or get someone else to do.
					But the former is recommended.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your progress will not be saved if you exit this tool.
					You can't save or open a project file using this tool,
					only export the final mod at the end.
